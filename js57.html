    <h2>Closures</h2>
    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from
      an inner function.

  <script>
    function init() {
      var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
      function displayName() {
        // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
        console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
      }
      displayName();
    }
    init();
  </script>
